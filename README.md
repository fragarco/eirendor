# EIRENDOR 1st EDITION FOUNDRY VTT SYSTEM

Foundry VTT system for playing Eirendor: El Albor de la Quinta Edad (Eirendor), a Spanish RPG based on 5e SRD.

## INTRODUCTION

As the original game was published only in Spanish, the current system primarily provides the translation for the character sheet, so the Referee will still have to do some work enlisting specific class talents, equipment, spells, and monsters for they campaign.

Eirendor is a CC-By-SA/OGL RPG game based on 3.X/5ed SRD. The two main books (main rules and monsters) where released free in PDF form by the creators/publishers. These books can be found here:

If you wish to manually install the system, you must clone or extract it into the "Data/systems/eirendor" folder.

## INSTRUCTIONS

As this game was only published in Spanish, I will be surprised if it gets played in English. As a result, the Spanish documentation (see LEEME.md) contains the instructions and it's kept up to date while this document is more for those people that wants to know what this is about but doesn't understand Spanish.
